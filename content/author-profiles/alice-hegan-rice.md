Alice Hegan Rice (1870–1942) was an American novelist best known for her popular novel *Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch* (1901). Born in Shelbyville, Kentucky, and later based in Louisville, Rice drew inspiration from her experiences working with the poor in Louisville’s slums. Her writing often depicted the resilience and humor of working-class women in the American South.

## Early Life and Literary Career

Alice Caldwell Hegan was born on January 11, 1870. She married Cale Young Rice, a poet and playwright, in 1902. Rice’s early volunteer work at a Louisville settlement house inspired her to write *Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch*, which became a bestseller and was translated into multiple languages. She published more than two dozen books, many of which explored themes of poverty, optimism, and community.

## Film Adaptations

Rice’s work was adapted for the screen numerous times, especially *Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch*, which inspired at least four film versions between 1914 and 1942. Her stories’ blend of humor and pathos made them popular choices for early filmmakers, and her characters helped shape the portrayal of rural and working-class women in American cinema.

## Legacy and Impact

Alice Hegan Rice’s novels were widely read in the early twentieth century and contributed to social awareness of poverty and women’s lives in the South. Her legacy endures through her influence on American popular fiction and the early film industry, even though her film adaptations have not survived. The University of Louisville preserves her papers, ensuring her contributions to literature and social reform are remembered.
