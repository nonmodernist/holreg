After her missionary father's death in the Ozarks, Pollyanna Whittier is sent to live with her wealthy Aunt Polly on a New England plantation. Despite her aunt’s harshness, Pollyanna befriends orphan Jimmy Bean and brings optimism to the community through her father’s “Glad Game”—finding something to be grateful for in every situation. 

When Pollyanna is struck by a car while saving a child, she becomes paralyzed. The accident forces Aunt Polly to confront her feelings and reconcile with Dr. Tom, her former love who can treat Pollyanna. With Dr. Tom’s help, Pollyanna recovers, Aunt Polly reunites with the doctor, and Jimmy is adopted by neighbor John Pendleton.

## Regional Focus

Set in a small Vermont town in the early 20th cenutry, the film captures New England's particular blend of material prosperity and emotional austerity. Vermont, with its Puritan heritage and small-town social hierarchies, represents a region caught between tradition and modernity in the film's post-World War I era. Pollyanna's origins in the Ozarks—associated with frontier evangelicalism and simple faith—provide a sharp contrast to the established wealth and social rigidity of her New England relatives. 

This regional tension between Western openness and Eastern reserve, between heartland spirituality and Northeastern sophistication, drives the narrative and reflects broader national conversations about American values during the 1920s. The film's fictional small town Vermont shows a prosperous but emotionally constrained community that needs the spiritual renewal Pollyanna brings from America's interior.

## Hollywood's Approach

### Filming Locations

While specific filming locations are not documented in available sources, the production was likely shot at the Pickford-Fairbanks Studio in Hollywood, with sets constructed to represent a quintessential New England town.

### Production and Adaptation

*Pollyanna* was produced by Mary Pickford’s own company in partnership with [United Artists](/studios/united-artists), the distribution company she co-founded in 1919 with Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and [D.W. Griffith](/directors/d-w-griffith) to give artists greater creative and financial control over their work. 

As one of the most powerful figures in early Hollywood, Pickford had the autonomy to choose her own projects and collaborators, as well as the money to pursue expensive screen rights—she reportedly paid $40,000 for Porter's 1913 novel. She frequently worked with the film's screenwriter, Frances Marion, who was one of the highest-paid and most successful screenwriters of the silent era, and who specialized in crafting strong female protagonists and adapting literary works for the screen. Marion’s expertise in literary adaptation made her an ideal choice for bringing Eleanor H. Porter’s beloved regional novel to film, while Pickford’s star power and production control ensured that this New England story would reach national audiences. Their collaboration represents the kind of creative partnership that allowed literary regionalism to flourish in early Hollywood, with women creators at both the production and writing levels shaping how regional American stories were told on screen.
