Opera singer Helen Lorfield Winter (Jeanette MacDonald) retreats from her career and city life after her young son Hank is killed in a truck accident while chasing his collie, Lassie. Overcome with grief and blaming herself and the dog, Helen travels to the mountain town of Brushy Gap where she rents a remote house. 

Despite her initial reluctance to engage with the community, Helen gradually forms a bond with Jerry, a young orphan who adores Lassie and helps her with daily tasks. When Jerry is injured and the local orphanage catches fire, Helen realizes her maternal feelings for the boy and decides to adopt him, choosing to remain in Brushy Gap rather than return to her opera career.

## Regional Focus

Set in the Great Smoky Mountains region, specifically in the fictional town of Brushy Gap. The film presents a romanticized vision of Appalachian mountain communities in the post-World War II era, drawing on established cultural associations of the region as a place of healing and spiritual renewal. The Great Smokies setting reflects the areaâ€™s emergence as a destination for urban refugees seeking solace in nature, particularly following the establishment of Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1934.

## Production and Adaptation

### Filming Locations

Locations for film were shot in Glenwood, California, north of Santa Cruz. The production used this rural California location to represent the fictional Great Smoky Mountains town of Brushy Gap, demonstrating Hollywood's continued practice of substituting accessible California landscapes for distant American regional settings. Glenwood's mountainous terrain and small-town atmosphere provided the rustic backdrop needed for the film's story of urban-to-rural transformation.
