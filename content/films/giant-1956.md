Texas cattle rancher Bick Benedict marries Eastern socialite Leslie Lynnton and brings her to his vast Reata Ranch. Leslie struggles to adapt to the harsh landscape and clashes with the entrenched racial hierarchies of South Texas. When ambitious ranch hand Jett Rink discovers oil on his small plot of land, the Benedict family watches their cattle empire transform as oil wealth reshapes the region's power structures. 

The rivalry between Bick and the newly wealthy Jett intensifies as both men represent different visions of Texas's future, while Leslie fights to instill her more progressive values in the next generation.

## Regional Focus
Set in South Texas during the early-to-mid 20th century transformation from ranching empire to oil economy (1920s-1950s). *Giant* portrays the twilight of the vast cattle ranch culture established by Anglo settlers in the late 19th century, where enormous spreads like the fictional Reata Ranch dominated hundreds of thousands of acres. 

The region's proximity to Mexico and significant Mexican-American population creates ongoing cultural tensions between Anglo ranch families and Hispanic communities, reflecting broader patterns of land dispossession and labor exploitation that followed the Mexican-American War. 

The discovery of oil beneath grazing land represents the seismic economic shift that transformed South Texas from an agricultural frontier into an industrial powerhouse, bringing new wealth, social mobility, and cultural conflicts while challenging traditional hierarchies of land, race, and class that had defined the region since Reconstruction.

## Hollywood's Approach

### Filming Locations

Shot on location at the Worth Evans Ranch, twenty-one miles from Marfa, Texas, where the imposing Benedict family home facade—built at the Warner Bros. prop department and shipped to Texas—still stands today. The landscape of West Texas provided the sweeping vistas of rangeland that define the film’s visual representation of cattle empire grandeur, though key elements like the oil derricks were also constructed in Hollywood and transported to the remote Texas location. Nearby Valentine served as the setting for the film’s Mexican village sequences, utilizing the area’s existing Hispanic community and architecture to represent the cross-cultural dynamics central to the story. 

Contrasting with the harsh beauty of the Texas borderlands, the Maryland sequences depicting Leslie’s patrician Eastern background were filmed at a seventeenth-century estate in Charlottesville, Virginia, emphasizing the cultural gulf between refined Eastern society and the raw, expansive world of South Texas ranching.

### Production and Adaptation

The production of *Giant* was notable for Edna Ferber's unprecedented level of creative control over the adaptation of her work. As J. E. Smyth notes, having witnessed MGM's dilution of her social critique when they remade *[Show Boat]* (1951), Ferber was determined to maintain influence over George Stevens' adaptation of *Giant*. When she sold the film rights in 1952, she negotiated an unusual power-sharing arrangement that made her one of three heads of Giant Productions, alongside Stevens and producer Henry Ginsberg.

Ferber also spent time on set as the film was shot, both on location and on the Warner's studio lot.

Warner Bros.' massive investment in transporting Hollywood-built sets to Texas demonstrates how studios by the 1950s were willing to pursue “authentic” locations while still controlling the visual narrative—the oil derricks built in Hollywood and shipped to Texas perfectly symbolize this tension between authenticity and artifice.

*Giant* was shot in Eastmancolor, rebranded as WarnerColor for the film’s marketing, part of the transition away from the expensive three-strip Technicolor process that Warner Bros. had begun in 1952. This shift in color technology proved particularly significant for representing the harsh, unromantic landscapes of South Texas. As film scholar Russell Merritt observes, by the mid-1950s color cinematography was moving beyond Technicolor’s glamorous formulas to tackle “colorless or harsh environments in color—oil fields, factories, brothels, steel mills—without making them pretty, picturesque, or contrived.” *Giant’s* oil field sequences exemplify this new approach, using the more muted, realistic color palette possible with Eastmancolor to capture the industrial transformation of the Texas landscape without romanticizing the environmental and social costs of the oil boom.
