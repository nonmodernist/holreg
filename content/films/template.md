## Notes

1. **California standing in for Indiana:** The trade press reported that the production moved to Southern California because the story's "western atmosphere... demands a typical California setting" for the Limberlost scenes. {{ cite(id="exhibitors_herald_1917") }} 

2. **Stratton-Porter's dissatisfaction:** In a biography written by her daughter, Stratton-Porter's frustration with the Lasky-Paramount adaptation is documented. She felt the studio had invited her input only to completely ignore her suggestions. {{ cite(id="meehan_1927") }} 

3. **Screenplay development:** Information about the screenplay drafts comes from the AFI Catalog entry for the film. {{ cite(id="afi_catalog_freckles") }}
