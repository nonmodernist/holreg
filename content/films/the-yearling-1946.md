Young Jody Baxter lives with his parents on a hardscrabble farm in the Florida scrub country shortly after the Civil War. When Jody's father is bitten by a rattlesnake and kills a doe to use its organs as a poultice, Jody adopts the doe's orphaned fawn, naming it Flag. 

As Flag grows from a playful fawn into a yearling, the deer becomes both Jody's closest companion and an increasing threat to the family's precarious survival, repeatedly destroying their meager crops. When Flag ruins the corn crop that represents the family's last hope for making it through the year, Jody's mother orders the deer killed. After Jody's father, crippled by his snakebite injury, fails to kill Flag cleanly, Jody must finish the job himself, marking his painful transition from childhood innocence to adult understanding of the harsh realities of frontier life.

## Regional Focus

Set in the Florida scrub country during the 1870s, the film depicts the harsh realities of subsistence farming in one of America's last "frontiers." The Baxter family's isolated homestead sits amid the palmetto scrub and pine flatwoods of north-central Florida, a region where sandy soil, unpredictable weather, and abundant wildlife made agriculture a constant struggle for post-Civil War settlers.

The story captures the precarious existence of Florida's "cracker" residents—poor white farmers who scratched out a living in the backwoods areas bypassed by plantation agriculture. Unlike the romanticized Old South of plantation fiction, the Florida scrub demanded brutal pragmatism: every crop failure meant potential starvation, every wild animal represented both a threat to survival and a potential meal. The film's central conflict—between Jody's love for his pet deer and the family's need to protect their crops—embodies the fundamental tension between sentiment and survival that defined life in this landscape.

The regional setting also reflects Florida's liminal position in the post-Reconstruction South, where scattered homesteaders lived largely outside the social and economic structures being contested elsewhere in the former Confederacy. The Baxters' isolation from town, law, and neighbors creates a world where family bonds and harsh natural laws are the only governing forces.

## Hollywood's Approach

### Filming Locations

{{ image(src="sidebar-theyearling1946.jpg", alt="A man and a boy hunt in the Florida scrub", caption="Gregory Peck and Claude Jarman Jr. navigate the Florida scrub with rifles ready", class="shadow rounded size-medium") }}

Shot primarily in the Ocala National Forest and Silver Springs, Florida, with additional filming at Lake Arrowhead, California, and the MGM backlot in Culver City. The production's troubled history reflects Hollywood's struggle to capture authentic regional environments: MGM leased a Florida farm and planted crops in 1940, built elaborate sets using 81,023 pounds of Spanish moss shipped from Florida, and later reconstructed the Baxter farm on the backlot using parts transported from the actual Florida location.

 ### Production and Adaptation

*The Yearling*'s tortured production history—spanning from 1941 to 1946 with multiple directors, cast changes, and budget overruns—illustrates both Hollywood's ambition to capture authentic regional environments and the industrial realities that ultimately forced compromise. MGM's initial commitment to authenticity was unprecedented: leasing a Florida farm in 1940, planting actual crops, and beginning location filming in the Ocala National Forest with a 300-person crew. Yet this very commitment to natural authenticity proved the production's undoing when the studio discovered that nature refused to conform to shooting schedules—the specially-raised fawns grew too fast for their roles, Florida's weather proved uncooperative, and hurricanes destroyed sets.

After two failed attempts under directors Victor Fleming and King Vidor, the studio announced in 1942 that filming would resume "entirely at the M-G-M studios," effectively abandoning the regionalist ideal of on-location authenticity. When Clarence Brown finally completed the film in 1945-46, he negotiated a middle ground between these extremes: salvaging some original Florida footage, conducting limited location shooting, but primarily working on MGM's backlot where a replica Baxter farm was constructed using materials shipped from Florida—including 81,023 pounds of Spanish moss. This hybrid approach, combining authentic regional elements within a controlled studio environment, revealed how Hollywood had learned to simulate rather than truly inhabit the American regions it sought to represent.
