In early 20th-century Brooklyn, the poor Nolan family struggles in their tenement flat. Katie works as a scrubwoman while her alcoholic husband Johnny works sporadically as a singing waiter. Their daughter Francie dreams of a better life and idolizes her father, who encourages her aspirations. When Johnny dies from pneumonia while job-hunting, Katie must raise Francie, son Neeley, and newborn Annie Laurie alone. Despite the hardships, Francie graduates from eighth grade and begins dating, while Katie finds companionship with kind police officer McShane. The story ends with hope as both Francie and the tree in their courtyard show signs of new growth.

## Regional Focus

Set in the Irish-American neighborhoods of early 20th-century Brooklyn, the film captures the immigrant working-class experience in one of New York City’s most densely populated boroughs. The tenement setting reflects the harsh realities of urban poverty during the Progressive Era, when Irish immigrants and other ethnic groups crowded into cramped housing while struggling for economic mobility. Brooklyn’s distinct neighborhood culture—with its mix of ethnic enclaves, local businesses, and tight-knit community bonds—serves as both backdrop and character in the story. 

The urban environment contrasts sharply with the rural settings typical of most American regionalist literature, representing instead the new American regional experience of immigrant city life, where dreams of prosperity collide with the daily grind of tenement existence.

## Hollywood's Approach 

### Filming Location

*A Tree Grows in Brooklyn* was filmed on the 20th Century-Fox studio lot in Century City, Los Angeles, where an elaborate four-story replica of a Brooklyn tenement house was constructed on a full sound stage. This massive set was described as one of the most mechanically complex and costly built on the Fox lot during the era, featuring working elevators that allowed cameras to capture continuous action across all floors in single takes.
