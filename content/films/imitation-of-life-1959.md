Struggling white actress Lora Meredith meets Annie Johnson, a Black single mother, when their daughters play together at Coney Island. Lora invites Annie and her light-skinned daughter Sarah Jane to live with her in exchange for housekeeping.

Over the next decade, Lora becomes a Broadway star while neglecting her daughter Susie. Meanwhile, Sarah Jane attempts to pass as white, repeatedly rejecting her devoted mother Annie. When Sarah Jane's white boyfriend discovers her heritage and beats her, she flees to work in nightclubs.

Sarah Jane continues rejecting Annie even when her dying mother travels to California for one final meeting. After Annie's death, Sarah Jane arrives at the funeral in tears, finally acknowledging her mother's love. The film ends with Lora, Susie, and Sarah Jane joining hands in mutual support.

## Regional Context

Depicts urban America during the post-war economic boom, primarily set in New York City’s competitive entertainment industry and later expanding to Los Angeles. The film captures the racial dynamics of Northern cities in the 1950s, where legal segregation was less overt than in the South but social and economic barriers persisted. 

The story reflects the Great Migration’s legacy, as African Americans like Annie Johnson sought better opportunities in Northern urban centers, while also exploring the complex realities of racial passing in cities where anonymity made such deception possible. The glamorous Broadway and Hollywood settings contrast sharply with the limited options available to Black Americans, even in supposedly more progressive Northern metropolitan areas.

## Filming Locations

Filmed primarily in Los Angeles, utilizing both studio and practical locations to create its New York and Hollywood settings. The production used Warner Bros. studio facilities, the United Methodist Church in Hollywood, California, and the Moulin Rouge nightclub in Los Angeles, which served as the seedy venue where Sarah Jane performs as a chorus girl.

## Production Context

Sirk's film demonstrates how the studio system's engagement with both regionalist literature and melodrama evolved to serve the aesthetic and ideological demands of the 1950s, transforming Hurst's Depression-era social realism into a critique of postwar American prosperity. Where [John Stahl's 1934 adaptation](@/films/imitation-of-life-1934.md) remained closer to the novel's economic survivalism, Sirk's remake reflects melodrama's turn towards what Thomas Elsaesser termed "tales of sound and fury," using the mode's emphasis on emotional excess and visual spectacle to expose the contradictions underlying mid-century domestic ideology.

Sirk's collaboration with cinematographer Russell Metty on *Imitation of Life* represents a crucial moment in the transition from Technicolor's three-strip process to single-strip color photography, utilizing Eastmancolor to achieve chromatic effects in the service of melodramatic expression. The film's color design builds upon Metty's earlier experiments with artificial illumination in Sirk's Technicolor productions, but the flexibility of Eastmancolor stock allowed for more nuanced manipulation of color temperature and saturation that enhanced what Scott Higgins identifies as Sirk's strategy of using "overt and determined organizations of color in melodramatic situations." 

Unlike the standardized color palette imposed by Technicolor's laboratory processes, Eastmancolor enabled Sirk and Metty to create what contemporary critics recognized as a distinctly "European" approach to Hollywood color design—one that employed chromatic artifice not merely for decorative purposes but as a systematic method of visual commentary on American social contradictions.

## Notes
1. **Filming locations:** Information about the filming locations from {{ cite(id="afi_imitation_1959") }} This was the one of the first of many films to feature the United Methodist Church in Hollywood. {{ cite(id="latimes_imitation_1959") }} When not a filming location, the Moulin Rouge nightclub hosted Vegas-style shows. {{ cite(id="turnbull_moulin_rouge") }}
2. **Elsaesser's theory of the family melodrama:** Elsaesser's influential essay "Tales of Sound and Fury" established the theoretical framework for understanding how 1950s melodrama functioned as ideological critique. The essay also suggests how it can be that regionalism and melodrama intersect—in the "claustrophobic atmosphere of the bourgeois home and/or the small-town setting." {{ cite(id="elsaesser_2012") }}
2. **Eastmancolor and melodrama:** Scott Higgins' "Chromo-Drama" provides essential technical and aesthetic context for understanding Sirk's color innovations, arguing against earlier critics who emphasized only the "distancing" effects of his artificial color schemes. {{ cite(id="higgins_chromodrama") }}
