Struggling white actress Lora Meredith meets Annie Johnson, a Black single mother, when their daughters play together at Coney Island. Lora invites Annie and her light-skinned daughter Sarah Jane to live with her in exchange for housekeeping.

Over the next decade, Lora becomes a Broadway star while neglecting her daughter Susie. Meanwhile, Sarah Jane attempts to pass as white, repeatedly rejecting her devoted mother Annie. When Sarah Jane's white boyfriend discovers her heritage and beats her, she flees to work in nightclubs.

Sarah Jane continues rejecting Annie even when her dying mother travels to California for one final meeting. After Annie's death, Sarah Jane arrives at the funeral in tears, finally acknowledging her mother's love. The film ends with Lora, Susie, and Sarah Jane joining hands in mutual support.

## Regional Context

Depicts urban America during the post-war economic boom, primarily set in New York City’s competitive entertainment industry and later expanding to Los Angeles. The film captures the racial dynamics of Northern cities in the 1950s, where legal segregation was less overt than in the South but social and economic barriers persisted. 

The story reflects the Great Migration’s legacy, as African Americans like Annie Johnson sought better opportunities in Northern urban centers, while also exploring the complex realities of racial passing in cities where anonymity made such deception possible. The glamorous Broadway and Hollywood settings contrast sharply with the limited options available to Black Americans, even in supposedly more progressive Northern metropolitan areas.

## Filming Locations

Filmed primarily in Los Angeles, utilizing both studio and practical locations to create its New York and Hollywood settings. The production used Warner Bros. studio facilities, the United Methodist Church in Hollywood, California, and the Moulin Rouge nightclub in Los Angeles, which served as the seedy venue where Sarah Jane performs as a chorus girl.
