In 1890s Cincinnati, spirited Ray Schmidt (Irene Dunne) works in her father's general store, flirting with traveling salesmen despite her stepmother’s disapproval. When she meets wealthy financier Walter Saxel, they fall in love despite his engagement to another woman. After a missed meeting separates them for five years, they reunite in New York. 

Though Walter is now married with children, Ray becomes his mistress, living in an apartment he provides while waiting for his infrequent visits. Despite inventor Kurt Shendler’s repeated marriage proposals and her growing loneliness, Ray cannot break free from Walter. Their affair continues for decades until Walter’s son Richard confronts her, demanding she leave his father. The next day, Walter suffers a fatal stroke. Devastated and left with no financial security, Ray dies of heartbreak, fantasizing about what might have been.

## Regional Focus

Moving from early 1900s Cincinnati to New York City, this 1932 adaptation joins a cycle of Hurst films dating back to *Humoresque* (1920) that established metropolitan New York as a distinct regional setting in American cinema. Unlike the rural locales most associated with literary regionalism, Hurst’s New York functions as an urban “region” defined by anonymity, economic precarity, and moral ambiguity—qualities that allow Ray to reinvent herself as Walter’s mistress away from Cincinnati’s social constraints. This urban regionalism would be refined in later Hurst adaptations like *Imitation of Life* (1934) and the subsequent *Back Street* remakes (1941, 1961), all of which use Manhattan's immigrant neighborhoods, boarding houses, and fashionable districts as distinctly regional backdrops for stories about women navigating the city’s promise and perils.
