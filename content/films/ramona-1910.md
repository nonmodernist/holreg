This silent short film chronicles the troubled romance between Ramona (Mary Pickford), a Spanish orphan from the prestigious Moreno family, and Alessandro (Henry B. Walthall), a Native American who appears on her family's ranch one day.

## Regional Focus

Set in Southern California during the post-Mexican War period (1840s-1850s) when California was transitioning to American control. It portrays the rancho culture of Spanish/Mexican California and the conflicts between European settlers, Spanish/Mexican landowners, and Native Americans. The film’s authentic Ventura County filming location reflects Griffith's early interest in Southern California, allowing him to showcase the actual landscapes described in Jackson’s novel.

## Production & Adaptation

### Filming Locations

Shot on location at Rancho Camulos in Ventura County, California, which Jackson visited while researching the novel. This site was known as the “Home of Ramona” and became a tourist destination after the novel's publication.
