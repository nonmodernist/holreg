Scarlett O'Hara's romantic obsessions and impulsive decisions unfold in an idealized vision of the Deep South rooted in Lost Cause mythology.

## Regional Focus

Set in Georgia during the 1860s-1870s, the film constructs the [Deep South](/regions/deep-south) as a region of gracious living and natural harmony disrupted by Northern aggression.  

The story centers on the rural Cotton Belt region, where large plantations like the fictional Tara relied on the labor of enslaved people to sustain the Southern aristocratic lifestyle. The narrative depicts the collapse of this plantation economy, the devastation of Sherman’s March to the Sea through Georgia, and the social upheaval of Reconstruction. However, the film presents a romanticized view of the Old South that glosses over the brutal realities of slavery and stereotypes its Black characters, while portraying the antebellum period as a lost golden age of genteel Southern culture.

As war destroys this mythologized plantation world, Scarlett's determination to restore Tara becomes a quest to resurrect an imagined regional identity that never truly existed. The story concludes with Scarlett's vow to rebuild, reflecting the film's broader project of reconstructing the Deep South as a space of romantic nostalgia rather than confronting the region's actual history of racial violence and economic inequality.

## Hollywood's Approach

### Filming Locations

Despite being set in Civil War-era Georgia, the film was shot entirely in California. Production began with the famous “Burning of Atlanta” sequence filmed on December 10, 1938, at the Selznick International backlot in Culver City. The Georgia plantation landscapes were recreated using various California locations, including Chico for some exterior scenes, Busch Gardens in Pasadena, and areas around Malibu, Big Bear, and Triunfo.

### Production and Adaptation

*Gone with the Wind* represents the apotheosis of Hollywood's engagement with Southern literature, marking a shift from the intimate regionalism of the 1910s and 1920s to the sweeping, nationally-oriented epics of the late studio era. 

Unlike earlier regionalist adaptations that often featured recurring creative personnel like producer/actress Mary Pickford or screenwriter Frances Marion working on multiple projects from the same geographic tradition, David O. Selznick's production operated as a prestige standalone project designed to transcend regional boundaries and appeal to national audiences. The film's approach to the American South differed markedly from the more authentic, location-specific treatments seen in earlier adaptations of authors like [Gene Stratton-Porter](@/author-profiles/gene-stratton-porter.md) or [Grace Miller White](@/author-profiles/grace-miller-white.md), instead creating a romanticized, studio-manufactured version of the antebellum and Reconstruction South that prioritized spectacle over regional authenticity or local color. Selznick's extensive creative control over the screenplay revisions and day-to-day production reflected the era's shift toward producer-driven projects that transformed regional source material into blockbuster entertainment properties.

 While Margaret Mitchell's novel was her only published work, preventing the kind of sustained author-studio relationships that characterized earlier regionalist cycles, *Gone with the Wind*'s massive success established a template for how major studios would approach prestigious literary adaptations in the 1940s and beyond, emphasizing production values and star power over the intimate regional authenticity that had defined many of Hollywood's earlier encounters with American women's regional fiction.

## Notes

1. **Romanticized view of the South:** Multiple Black writers of the era compared the film to D. W. Griffith's 1915 epic *Birth of a Nation*: 
    - Playwright Carlton Moss, writing in *The Daily Worker*, wrote that while the earlier epic had been a "frontal attack on American history and the Negro people," *Gone with the Wind* was "a rear attack...sugar-smeared and blurred by a boresome Hollywood love story." {{ cite(id="moss_1940") }} 
    - Poet Melvin B. Tolson wrote, "*Birth of a Nation* was such a barefaced lie that a moron could see through it. *Gone with the Wind* is such a subtle lie that it will be swallowed as truth by millions of whites and blacks alike." {{ cite(id="tolson_undated") }}
