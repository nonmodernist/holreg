Scarlett O'Hara, a headstrong Southern belle, lives on a Georgia plantation during the Civil War. Obsessed with Ashley Wilkes, who marries his cousin Melanie, she marries Melanie's brother out of spite but is soon widowed.

As war devastates the South, Scarlett fights to save her family's plantation from poverty. She's pursued by Rhett Butler, a roguish man who genuinely loves her despite her manipulative nature. Desperate for money, she marries wealthy Frank Kennedy, but he's later killed during Reconstruction.

Scarlett eventually marries Rhett and they have a daughter, but her continued obsession with Ashley drives Rhett away. The story ends with Scarlett vowing to win back Rhett, declaring "Tomorrow is another day" as she resolves to rebuild her life.

## Regional Context

Set in Georgia during the 1860s-1870s, the film portrays the antebellum South’s plantation society and its transformation through the Civil War and Reconstruction. The story centers on the rural Cotton Belt region, where large plantations like Tara relied on enslaved labor to sustain the Southern aristocratic lifestyle. The narrative depicts the collapse of this plantation economy, the devastation of Sherman’s March to the Sea through Georgia, and the social upheaval of Reconstruction. However, the film presents a romanticized view of the Old South that glosses over the brutal realities of slavery while portraying the antebellum period as a lost golden age of genteel Southern culture.

## Filming Locations

Despite being set in Civil War-era Georgia, the film was shot entirely in California. Production began with the famous “Burning of Atlanta” sequence filmed on December 10, 1938, at the Selznick International backlot in Culver City. The Georgia plantation landscapes were recreated using various California locations, including Chico for some exterior scenes, Busch Gardens in Pasadena, and areas around Malibu, Big Bear, and Triunfo.
