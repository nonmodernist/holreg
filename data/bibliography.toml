quote = """As both an educated woman and an easternborn outsider, Leslie functions as Ferber's constant critical voice... 

While Ferber's novel, via the perspective of her heroine, Leslie, attacks the mythology of the traditional masculine, western narrative, Hendler and others have claimed that director George Stevens's film adaptation made some effort to rehabilitate Bick's racism and bolster the patriarchy (thus making it more acceptable to Texas and national viewers). Although Hendler's contrasting readings of the novel and film are persuasive, she ignores two of Ferber's most fundamental themes: the woman in the West as narrator and critic of history, and the protagonist as a racial and gender hybrid. Like Cimarron's Sabra Cravat and especially Ferber herself, Leslie comes to question the male-dominated frontier. But more than Sabra, Leslie is interested in the intersections of race and gender in this masculine space. An outsider, she is strangely drawn to another Texas hybrid who first alerts her to the racial injustice on Reata, the poor white cowhand Jett Rink. 

George Stevens would also pursue the film's gender and racial issues, most memorably in showing Leslie (Elizabeth Taylor) actively bettering the living conditions for Mexican Americans on Reata and in visualizing the racial otherness of Jett Rink (James Dean). Yet Stevens's deployment of Ferber's critique was in the end more palatable to Texas and national audiences. It was not simply that the film softens Ferber's muckraking criticism, in particular by eliminating many of her overt connections between African American and Mexican American Jim Crow laws. Leslie's introspective character and her critical perspective on Texas racism and chauvinism are marginalized by the epic icons of more traditional western cinema‚Äî boots and saddles, lone cowboys, cattle, expansive empires, wealth, and sheer bigness. These images dominate the screen and even Leslie's critical voice. [...]

[Stevens] made extensive notes on his copy [of the novel], highlighting the scenes of racial prejudice against Mexican Americans, including the near ejection of a Latin American ambassador from Jett's hotel (later cut), Leslie's comparisons between the Mexican shantytowns and those for African Americans in the South (never used by the screenwriters), Angel's emerging pachuco (Mexican American youth) identity (also cut), and Leslie's inflammatory comment to Jett that the Mexican Americans at Reata were ‚Äúmore American than you [and her husband] are.‚Äù But Stevens was also in love with the West and the western hero; his last film, *Shane* (1953), proved as much. His desire to condemn racism and enshrine the old-style toughness of the western hero would result in a deeply conflicted western. [...]

Leslie‚Äôs abortive attempts in the novel to improve the living and working conditions of the Mexican Americans attached to the Reata ranch economy were actually made realities in the script. It is Leslie who first works with Dr. Guerra on the Nopal settlements, not her son, Jordy. Whereas Ferber‚Äôs Leslie was thwarted at every turn, Stevens invested her with more traditional frontier ingenuity and success. However, as a result, the few Mexican American characters appear far more powerless and victimized than in Ferber‚Äôs novel. In *Giant*, Ferber briefly discusses the rise of LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) and postwar‚Äì Latin American activism and chronicles the friendship between Jordy and Angel Obregon. However, Stevens made the white Leslie the instigator of social change."""

They are still in the middle of frontier growing pains of which chauvinism is so much a part, but I cannot but be amused by the fierceness and passion of their reactions." """

quote = """Ferber may have suspected that Stevens would not adopt all her book's incisive critique. When MGM remade *Show Boat*, it excised much of her original attack on southern racism and antimiscegenation laws. So she kept an eye on Stevens. When she sold the film rights in 1952, Ferber retained her usual copyright reversion and television rights, but also acquired a percentage in Giant Productions. She, Stevens, and producer Henry Ginsberg were the three heads of Giant Productions. It was almost unprecedented for a writer, even a historical novelist of Ferber's national stature, to acquire this kind of powersharing deal in a film production. As *Variety* noted, ‚ÄúThe G-S-F setup will also embrace future filming of previous Ferber works, including remakes of some of her past film successes, rights to which have reverted [to her].‚Äù

But Ferber wanted more than executive privileges and a percentage of the profits. Preserving *Giant*'s critique of frontier racism was important, and she wanted to help construct the screenplay, particularly after she saw Moffat and Guiol's first draft. ‚ÄúI want to work as an unsalaried writer,‚Äù she wrote to Ginsberg.

All told, she spent eleven weeks in Hollywood working on the script, advising on technical issues, and meeting with the cast and crew in Texas. [...]

In spite of her status as coproducer, most of Ferber's script comments were ignored. It was not an experience she liked. As she later wrote to her editor at Doubleday, ‚ÄúI got myself into something really grisly when, in my youth and innocence, I came out here to write the Giant dialogue... The script dialogue was beyond belief at that time. I never would have permitted it to be used. For eight weeks, at exactly nothing a week, I've been working with a young man named Ivan Moffett [sic].‚Äù Of Moffat's and Hollywood's taste in writers in general, she was scathing: ‚ÄúHe is 36, charming, talented, sensitive; he has taste, a feeling for words; he can't write worth a damn, he is indolent and can't do a real day's work. He knows as much about Texas as I know about Iran. Less.‚Äù She continued, ‚ÄúIf I get out of this town without killing him it will be the greatest known triumph of restraint against honest impulse.‚Äù

page = "170‚Äì178"
quote = """Douglas Sirk's cycle of 1950s melodramas earned him recognition as one of Hollywood's preeminent colorists. Along with Vincente Minnelli and perhaps Nicholas Ray, Sirk raised the aesthetic profile of the domestic melodrama in the 1950s by innovating expressive forms of color lighting and mise-en-sc√®ne. These qualities were understood by the first wave of Sirk's auteur critics as generating a distancing, self-conscious artifice... Sirk's colors do ring of artifice, but at the same time they exact emotion. Following Barbara Klinger's seminal observations on melodrama (1994), I want to suggest that the modernist argument can obscure the affective power of Sirk's color designs, the way that color answered the overt expressive demands of mid-century melodrama.

My goal in this chapter is to begin placing Sirk's work in a formal history of color aesthetics. I argue that against the background of Technicolor design, what stood out as opaque artifice to Sirk's late champions was also a nuanced engagement with craft practice. This is not to claim that Sirk's designs, the careful matching of costume and mise-en-sc√®ne or the intensive colored lighting were ever perceived as "natural." Rather, the kind of artifice they represent is part of a larger tradition. Attention to formal context allows us to better specify the nature of Sirk's innovations.

Sirk's color design tactics often draw on earlier models for deploying overt and determined organizations of color in melodramatic situations. [...]

To gain depth and specificity, I will focus on one of the most notable chromatic instruments in Sirk's color orchestration, colored illumination. Cinematographer Russell Metty's experiments with blue, gold, and multicolored light in *All that Heaven Allows* are the best-known examples of projected color in Sirk's canon, though the practice persists in *Written on the Wind* (1956) and *Imitation of Life*. Mary Beth Haralovich suggests that Metty's lighting is both expressive and obtrusive. She notes that colored light intrudes "on the realist narrative space" and "functions as a signifier of the psychic and sexual energy that cannot be contained or expressed by the narrative in the usual ways" (Haralovich 1990: 66, 69). Russell Merritt echoes Camper and Willemen, concluding, "the blue swatches feel entirely cut off from the referenced world, operating entirely within the framework of ... genre pastiche... Light itself ... is 'light' only in an approximate sense ‚Äì an approximation of sunlight and an approximation of reading light" (Merritt 2008: 12)."""

[...]

In Hollywood melodrama characters made for operettas play out the human tragedies (which is how they experience the contradictions of American civilization). Small wonder they are constantly baffled and amazed, as Lana Turner is in *Imitation of Life*, about what is going on around them and within them. The tensions of seeming and being, of intention and result, register as a perplexing frustration, and an everincreasing gap opens between the emotions and the reality they seek to reach. What strikes one as the true pathos is the very mediocrity of the human beings involved, putting such high demands upon themselves, trying to live up to an exalted vision of the human being, but instead living out the impossible contradictions that have turned the American dream into its proverbial nightmare. It makes the best American melodramas of the fifties not only critical social documents but genuine tragedies, despite or rather because of the happy ending: they record some of the agonies that have accompanied the demise of the "affirmative culture."
